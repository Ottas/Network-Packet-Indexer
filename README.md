# Network-Packet-Indexer 

## Objective

Our goal with this project is to show how an analyst can work with multiple PCAPs in a more organized way, without getting lost in thousands of packets.`Arkime` groups packets between source and destination, while Wireshark shows every single one. So for the same event, Arkime might show 10 events, but Wireshark could display 20,000 events.Thatâ€™s why we decided to go deeper into Arkime to show how it can help make analysis clearer and more manageable.`Arkime` is a powerful network capture and analysis tool that ingests, indexes, and allows fast searching of PCAP data using Elasticsearch.Elasticsearch is the search database technology that feed Arkime.
