# Network-Packet-Indexer 

## Objective

Our goal with this project is to show how an analyst can work with multiple PCAPs in a more organized way, without getting lost in thousands of packets.`Arkime` groups packets between source and destination, while Wireshark shows every single one. So for the same event, Arkime might show 
10 events, but Wireshark could display 20,000 events.Thatâ€™s why we decided to go deeper into Arkime to show how it can help make analysis clearer and more manageable.


### Skills Learned

- Analyzed and interpreted network logs to identify relevant events.
- Used graphs to visualize IPs and network activity, gaining a clearer and more comprehensive overview.
- Developed skills in generating and recognizing attack signatures and patterns.
- Improved understanding of network protocols and common security vulnerabilities. 
- Integrated OSINT tools into our environment for efficient data ingestion and enhanced threat analysis.

### Tools Used

- Arkime - Network capture analysis tool for examining network traffic.
- OSINT tools - Used `urlscan.io` to check IP and URL reputation
- Malware-Traffic-Analysis - Utilized Malware Traffic Analysis for creating and studying network traffic and malware behavior.
- Wireshark - Used Wireshark to capture and analyze relevant network packets

##Summary
Arkime is a powerful network capture and analysis tool that ingests, indexes, and allows fast searching of PCAP data using Elasticsearch.Elasticsearch is the search database technology that feed Arkime.
