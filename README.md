# Network-Packet-Indexer 

## Objective

Our goal with this project is to show how an analyst can work with multiple PCAPs in a more organized way, without getting lost in thousands of packets.`Arkime` groups packets between source and destination, while Wireshark shows every single one. So for the same event, Arkime might show 
10 events, but Wireshark could display 20,000 events.Thatâ€™s why we decided to go deeper into Arkime to show how it can help make analysis clearer and more manageable.


### Skills Learned

- Analyzed and interpreted network logs to identify relevant events.
- Used graphs to visualize IPs and network activity, gaining a clearer and more comprehensive overview.
- Developed skills in generating and recognizing attack signatures and patterns.
- Improved understanding of network protocols and common security vulnerabilities. 
- Integrated OSINT tools into our environment for efficient data ingestion and enhanced threat analysis.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

##Summary
Arkime is a powerful network capture and analysis tool that ingests, indexes, and allows fast searching of PCAP data using Elasticsearch.Elasticsearch is the search database technology that feed Arkime.
